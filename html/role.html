                <h2 id="counselor">Counselor</h2>
                <h3><strong>Key Ability: </strong>Culture</h3>
                <p>Serving as the kingdom’s moral compass and public voice, the Counselor bridges the gap between ruler
                    and
                    citizen. They listen to the people’s concerns, interpret their will, and translate policies into
                    actions
                    the populace understands and accepts. A skilled Counselor builds trust and ensures that the
                    government
                    leads with empathy as well as wisdom.</p>

                <h3><strong>Key Ability: </strong>Loyalty</h3>
                <p>Part diplomat, part spymaster, the Emissary deals in secrets, alliances, and subtle influence.
                    Whether
                    acting openly as a high-ranking envoy or operating in the shadows, they shape both internal
                    politics and
                    foreign relations. Their hands may be clean—or stained—but their actions secure the kingdom’s
                    interests
                    in a dangerous world.</p>
            </div>

                <p>The General commands the kingdom’s military forces and oversees their readiness in peace and
                    prowess in
                    war. They lead armies, manage garrisons, and ensure that the kingdom's borders are defended with
                    strength and discipline. Their decisions can win wars—or prevent them entirely.</p>

                <h3><strong>Key Ability: </strong>Culture</h3>
                <p>The Magister governs the kingdom’s magical affairs, from spellcasting schools to arcane
                    infrastructure.
                    They balance the realm's mystical forces, ensure that magical knowledge is used wisely, and help
                    integrate supernatural resources into everyday governance. In a world shaped by magic, their
                    guidance
                    keeps both wonders and terrors in check.

                <p>The Ruler is the sovereign heart of the kingdom — the final word in law, diplomacy, and
                    governance. They
                    preside over major state ceremonies, sign laws into being, pardon criminals, and appoint all
                    major
                    officials. Their leadership sets the tone for the entire realm, from the battlefield to the
                    marketplace,
                    and their vision becomes the kingdom’s destiny.

                <h3><strong>Key Ability: </strong>Economy</h3>
                <p>Guardian of the realm’s purse, the Treasurer oversees trade, taxation, and fiscal policy. They
                    ensure
                    markets remain fair, industries thrive, and corruption is rooted out. A savvy Treasurer keeps
                    the
                    economy flowing, investments growing, and confidence in the kingdom’s future strong.

                <h3><strong>Key Ability: </strong>Economy</h3>
                <p>The Viceroy is the architect of the kingdom’s expansion and infrastructure. They chart new
                    territory,
                    plan settlement growth, build roads and bridges, and develop connections between cities and the
                    wilds.
                    Their work ensures the kingdom’s lifeblood — travel, trade, and communication — remains strong
                    and
                    resilient.

                    against
                    regional threats, and keeps order in untamed territories. They act as a watchful guardian over
                    rural
                    areas and ensure that the reach of the law extends beyond the city walls. The Warden is the
                    kingdom’s
                    shield against chaos.
