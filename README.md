## TODO
1. fix break point at 500px on home page where characters overflow off bottom of main section.
2. replace boxes with character names with pictures
3. finish filling out all the content NO MORE LOREM IPSUM



## TODO FROM PEER REVIEW
1. ~~It could be helpful to increase the font size for the text that describes the Kingdom and its details on the homepage, and switching the font to be on top might also be a nice way to grab someone’s attention. ~~

2. ~~The logo is really captivating. It might also be nice to add an image to the title header in the homepage, but the consistency is great either way!~~

3. ~~For pages with longer content, like the Leaders page, it might help the include a link that takes the user back to the top of the page, or perhaps a list with names that takes users straight to what they’re looking for.~~

4. ~~Your home page is very well laid out, however, one recommendation I have is to fix the break with the logo that is experienced with a smaller screen. Currently, it does not show up and has no alternative description.~~

5. ~~Your navigation bar correlates very well with the color scheme you have throughout your pages. One recommendation I have, however, is that of making the title pop out more. For example, using a lighter shade of red or a different font would draw more attention.~~

6. ~~Your leaders and companion pages seem very detailed. One recommendation I have, however, is to add images of the characters you include.~~
